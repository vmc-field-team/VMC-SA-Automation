# hank2.0

This repository got created to make the Automation we did for Labs and Workshops public available for reuse.

# Create Docker Container
Dockerfiles are located in workshop/vmcworkshop & cmvmcworkshop. The Docker Container are not special, one is running python:3.8.5-alpine and the second Powerclicore.

I recommend to name the python Container "vmcworkshop" and the powercli "cmvmcprep", so no changes to the shell scripts need to be done.
